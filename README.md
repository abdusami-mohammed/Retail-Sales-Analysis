# Retail-Sales-Analysis
My role. Data Analyst | Power BI Expert.

## Project description. 

### Problem:
Atliq relied on static reports and manual processes for sales analysis, taking 5 days to prepare 
and providing limited visibility into underperforming markets and customers.

### Solution:
Developed a centralized SQL database and an interactive Power BI dashboard. 
The dashboard visualized key sales metrics, offering real-time insights into revenue, trends, and profitability across regions and products.

### Impact:
The integrated solution auto-refreshed with new data, 
revealing underperforming markets and customers with low-profit margins for timely decision-making.
