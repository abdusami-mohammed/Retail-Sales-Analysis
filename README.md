## Project description. 
### Problem:
Atliq relied on static reports and manual processes for sales analysis, which took up to five days to prepare. This method provided limited visibility into underperforming markets and customers, hindering timely decision-making and operational efficiency.

### Solution:
To address these challenges, I developed a centralized SQL database and an interactive Power BI dashboard. The dashboard visualized key sales metrics, offering real-time insights into revenue, trends, and profitability across various regions and product lines.

### Key Features:

- **Dynamic Visualizations:** The dashboard provides in-depth insights into revenue breakdowns, sales quantities, and profit margins, allowing stakeholders to track market performance effectively.
- **Alert Feature:** A custom alert system highlights markets or customers whose profit margins fall below a predetermined percentage, ensuring immediate attention to underperforming segments.
- **Automated Data Refresh:** With an integrated solution that auto-refreshes with new data, decision-makers can continuously monitor underperforming markets and identify customers with low-profit margins.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for ease of use, the dashboard allows non-technical users to explore data intuitively, ensuring accessibility for all team members.

### Impact:
The integrated solution auto-refreshes with new data, significantly enhancing visibility into the sales landscape. It empowers Atlix to identify underperforming markets and customers swiftly, leading to more informed, data-driven decision-making and improved operational efficienc
