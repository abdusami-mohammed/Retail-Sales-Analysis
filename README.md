## Project Overview:
This project aims to analyze sales data from Atliq to help the company make better, data-driven decisions. The focus is on transforming raw sales data into actionable insights through a centralized SQL database and an interactive Power BI dashboard.

### Data Source:
The project started by importing raw sales data into a SQL database.
The data included information on sales transactions, product details, customer segments, and regional markets from 2017 to 2020.
### Data Cleaning & Preparation:
Using SQL, the data was cleaned to remove duplicates, inconsistencies, and irrelevant fields.
I also created new calculated columns to derive additional metrics, such as profit margins and sales performance indicators across different regions and customer groups.
### Data Modeling:
Once cleaned, the data was structured to establish relationships between various tables (sales, products, customers, regions).
This structured data was imported into Power BI for visualization, ensuring an efficient flow between the database and the dashboard for real-time updates.
### Tools Used:
SQL (PostgreSQL) for database creation, data cleaning, and data preparation.
Power BI for building interactive dashboards, applying filters, and developing dynamic visualizations.
DAX queries in Power BI to generate complex calculations for KPIs and alert features.
### What We Did:
I developed and integrated a dynamic Power BI dashboard that provided visual insights into key performance metrics, including revenue trends, profit margins, and sales quantities.
Automated data refresh enabled real-time analysis, while the alert system flagged any regions or customers falling below a set profitability threshold.

### Problem:
Atliq relied on static reports and manual processes for sales analysis, which took up to five days to prepare. This method provided limited visibility into underperforming markets and customers, hindering timely decision-making and operational efficiency.

### Solution:
To address these challenges, I developed a centralized SQL database and an interactive Power BI dashboard. The dashboard visualized key sales metrics, offering real-time insights into revenue, trends, and profitability across various regions and product lines.

### Key Features:

- **Dynamic Visualizations:** The dashboard provides in-depth insights into revenue breakdowns, sales quantities, and profit margins, allowing stakeholders to track market performance effectively.
- **Alert Feature:** A custom alert system highlights markets or customers whose profit margins fall below a predetermined percentage, ensuring immediate attention to underperforming segments.
- **Automated Data Refresh:** With an integrated solution that auto-refreshes with new data, decision-makers can continuously monitor underperforming markets and identify customers with low-profit margins.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for ease of use, the dashboard allows non-technical users to explore data intuitively, ensuring accessibility for all team members.

### Impact:
The integrated solution auto-refreshes with new data, significantly enhancing visibility into the sales landscape. It empowers Atlix to identify underperforming markets and customers swiftly, leading to more informed, data-driven decision-making and improved operational efficiency.
